          <span className="outlink">â†—</span> as a Senior Product Designer. At Informed, I practiced user-centered design methodology to create impactful user experiences to increase customer success, and percieved value. 
          
          Part of that meant creating and defining visual interface and interaction patterns in adherence to brand principles and usability guidelines.</p>

          However, I also actively contributed to brand design,  institutionalized a design system, and took agency of design team operations, all while coding the experiences that I was creating.

          At Informed, I worked alongside incredibly talented individuals and
          learned so much from them every day. Over time, I built influence
          within the organization, which allowed me to impact product strategy
          and create team processes that improved team output. These
          opportunities allowed me to sharpen my literacy and understanding in
          other areas of the organization.

          kicking back with friends, camping, hiking, snowboarding, supporting
          Liverpool Football Club, baking sourdough bread or trying out
          something completely new and unusual. Life begins where your comfort
