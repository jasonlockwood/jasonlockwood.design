          <span className="outlink">â†—</span> as a Senior Product Designer. The
          Informed team was small and nimble. Being a part of a small team meant
          owning many responsibilities. Primarily, I practiced human-centered
          methodology to design impactful user experiences and crafted interface
          patterns in adherence to brand principles and usability guidelines.
          But I also designed and developed the brand, institutionalized a
          design system, and led design team operations, all while coding the
          experiences that I was creating.

          At Informed, I worked alongside incredibly talented individuals and
          learned so much from them every day. Over time, I built influence
          within the organization, which allowed me to impact product strategy
          and create team processes that improved team output. These
          opportunities allowed me to sharpen my literacy and understanding in
          other areas of the organization.

          Liverpool Football Club, baking sourdough bread or trying out
          something completely new and unusual. Life begins where your comfort
